Java Type Casting
Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

    int myInt = 9;
    double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

    double myDouble = 9.78;
    int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int
